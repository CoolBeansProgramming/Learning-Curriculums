# Learning Roadmap 

I have complied inforatmion from across the web and other roadmaps to create two of my own road maps that best fits my needs: one for computer science and one for data science. As I come from a math and satistics background with a little bit of programming experience I did not list introductory courses or material for statistics. In both road maps I did include some courses to review the main topics most needed in computer and data science, skipping over foundation courses like Calculus 1 and 2. I also included a few quick resources to refresh my self on statistical concepts at the beginning of the data science road map. 

I focused on using Python for this road map as that seems to be the mostly popular language to analyze data and create machine learning models. I also have experience using R before and wanted to learn more Python instead. The Time Series section is also large because I have no exerpeicne creating time series models. 

Although some of the time durations for Coursera courses seem like a lot, the course instructors antcipated that each student would work on the material once or twice a week. Therefore if a course says it takes two months to complete, you can likely get it done within a week or two if working on it a couple times a week. Courses and resources that would definitely take some time to complete include any of the books and the courses that were previously taught at a university. 

The courses and links are somewhat in order; some topics can easily be learned at the same time while with other sections you should give your entire attention to. 

All the useful links I have included have been useful to me either while learning statistics or are sources I always turn to when I get stuck. The documentaion of the program or software you are using as well as stackoverflow are helpful as well.
