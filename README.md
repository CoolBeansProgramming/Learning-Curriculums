# Learning Roadmap 

I have complied information from across the web and other roadmaps to create my own that best fits my needs and have included some courses to review the main topics most needed in data and computer science including a section on mathematics and statistics.

I have listed courses in the order in which I think they should be learned. Some topics can easily be learned at the same time while with other sections you should give your entire attention to. 

All the useful links I have included have been useful to me either while learning statistics or are sources I always turn to when I get stuck. The documentation of the program or software you are using as well as stack overflow are helpful as well.
