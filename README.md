# Learning Roadmap 

I have complied information from across the web and other roadmaps to create my own that best fits my needs and have included some courses to review the main topics most needed in data and computer science: mathematics and statistics.

I first focus on learning Python for this road map as that seems to be the mostly popular language to analyze data and create machine learning models. I also have experience using R before and wanted to learn more Python instead. The Time Series section is also large because I have no experience creating time series models. 

Although some of the time durations for Coursera courses seem like a lot, the course instructors anticipated that each student would work on the material once or twice a week. Therefore, if a course says it takes two months to complete, you can likely get it done within a week or two if working on it a couple times a week. Courses and resources that would take some time to complete include any of the books and the courses that were previously taught at a university. 

I have listed courses in the order in which I think they should be learned. Some topics can easily be learned at the same time while with other sections you should give your entire attention to. 

All the useful links I have included have been useful to me either while learning statistics or are sources I always turn to when I get stuck. The documentation of the program or software you are using as well as stack overflow are helpful as well.
