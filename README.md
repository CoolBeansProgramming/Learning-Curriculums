# Learning Roadmap 

I have complied information from across the web and other roadmaps to create two of my own that best fits my needs: one for data science and one for computer science. In both road maps I included some courses to review the main topics most needed in data and computer science. I created a third space solely for statistics and mathematics that can be reviewed for both data science and computer science. 

I focused on using Python for this road map as that seems to be the mostly popular language to analyze data and create machine learning models. I also have experience using R before and wanted to learn more Python instead. The Time Series section is also large because I have no experience creating time series models. 

Although some of the time durations for Coursera courses seem like a lot, the course instructors anticipated that each student would work on the material once or twice a week. Therefore, if a course says it takes two months to complete, you can likely get it done within a week or two if working on it a couple times a week. Courses and resources that would take some time to complete include any of the books and the courses that were previously taught at a university. 

I have listed courses in the order in which I think they should be learned. Some topics can easily be learned at the same time while with other sections you should give your entire attention to. 

All the useful links I have included have been useful to me either while learning statistics or are sources I always turn to when I get stuck. The documentation of the program or software you are using as well as stack overflow are helpful as well.
